# 10x Dog Show

A modern web application for digitizing and streamlining dog show documentation processes. This application replaces the traditional manual paper-based system with a digital solution that improves accuracy, speed, and efficiency in dog show evaluations.

## Project Description

10x Dog Show addresses the critical inefficiencies in traditional dog show documentation where ring secretaries manually transcribe judges' evaluations on paper forms. The current process suffers from:

- **Poor readability** of handwritten notes
- **Inaccuracy** in transcriptions
- **Slow documentation** process
- **Paper waste** and environmental impact
- **Difficulties** in archiving and searching historical data

### Key Features

- **Digital Dog Show Management**: Create, edit, and manage show templates with configurable dates, locations, and participants
- **Real-time Documentation**: Create, edit, and review dog descriptions with time-based editing restrictions
- **User Role Management**: Multi-level access control with different permissions for representatives, secretaries, and judges
- **Automated Communication**: Automatic PDF generation and email delivery of dog descriptions to owners
- **Configurable Evaluation System**: Customizable sets of evaluations, titles, and placements for different dog classes
- **GDPR Compliance**: Built-in consent management and automatic data deletion after 3 years
- **Real-time Updates**: Live notifications and data synchronization during shows

### Target Users

- **Ring Secretaries**: Streamlined documentation process with digital forms
- **Judges**: Clear, readable evaluation records and easy review capabilities
- **Show Organizers**: Comprehensive show management and participant tracking
- **Dog Owners**: Professional PDF documentation delivered automatically
- **Kennel Clubs**: Centralized data management and historical archiving
